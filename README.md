# Walpole Robotics Scouting App
The aim of the Walpole Robotics Scouting App is to refine and simplify the [Red Hawk Robotics](https://github.com/FRC2713) QR Scouting App. This open-source project focuses on enabling easy configuration and code editing without the need for compilation, a feature necessitated by their use of Typescript.
