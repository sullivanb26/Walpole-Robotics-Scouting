# Walpole Robotics QRScout
The Walpole Robotics QRScout App is designed with the aim of refining and simplifying the QR Scouting App of [Red Hawk Robotics](https://github.com/FRC2713). This project leverages the simplicity and power of basic web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The use of these file types facilitates easy configuration and code editing, eliminating the need for compilation, a feature necessitated by Red Hawk Robotics' use of Typescript.
This project was initially conceived and prototyped during the 2023 Season, Charged Up. The inception of the first prototype occurred during a car ride home after a competition, inspired by Red Hawk Robotics' HTML file. At this stage, the site was static and did not incorporate the use of configuration files for dynamic creation.
