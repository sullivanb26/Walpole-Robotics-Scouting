# Walpole Robotics QRScout
The Walpole Robotics QRScout App is designed with the aim of refining and simplifying the QR Scouting App of [Red Hawk Robotics](https://github.com/FRC2713). This project leverages the simplicity and power of basic web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The use of these file types facilitates easy configuration and code editing, eliminating the need for compilation, a feature necessitated by Red Hawk Robotics' use of Typescript.
